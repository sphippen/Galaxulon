GAME USAGE
There are two ways to run the game:
1. In a Gameboy Advance emulator
2. On hardware
Option 2 is beyond the scope of this file, so we'll focus on the first.
To run Galaxulon in an emulator, open the Galaxulon.gba file in your emulator.
Here are the basic game controls (with default VisualBoyAdvance key mappings)

VBA Mapping | GBA Button | Functionality
========================================
Arrow keys  | D-Pad      | Move Ship
Z key       | A          | Primary Fire
X key       | B          | Secondary Fire
A key       | L          | Bomb
S key       | R          | Toggle focused/wide primary fire
Enter       | Start      | Pause game

Persistent high scores are saved with a file called "Galaxulon.sav" when using
VisualBoyAdvance, and other emulators will likely have similar behavior.
